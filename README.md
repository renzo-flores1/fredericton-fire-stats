# Fredericton Fire Stats

This dataset is derived from Fredericton Open Data website ([text](https://data-fredericton.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/structure-fire-stats-2000-june2024/explore))

The data lists all the fire incidents in Fredericton and surrounding areas from years 2000 to 2024. The dataset description is listed in the website, but is also found in `data/data_description.txt`.

In this repository, I will analyze the relationships among all features, performing data analysis and extracting meaningful insights from it. I will also predict the `Under_Control` variable based from the other features
